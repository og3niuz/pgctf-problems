# Porter-Gaud CTF - Problem Set
![pgctf](pgctf.png)
---
Web problems (and Algo 1) were uploaded to a server using Docker in order to isolate them from each other, and were put on different network interfaces in order to give each problem a different IP address, rather than cluttering ports on one server.
We used the [Facebook Platform](https://github.com/facebook/fbctf) to host the scoreboard

Halfway through the competition, a server (10.10.1.77) was added to the scope with no description, but a corresponding flag in "Libya."  The server was loaded with an unpatched version of Windows XP vulnerable to [MS08-067](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi), exploitable with [this Metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi).
