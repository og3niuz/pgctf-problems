## Algorithm 1
algorithm - 125 points

Description
------------
We were able to breach the home email server of the 400lb Russian Hackers!
The bad news: in the database dump, all of the passwords are encrypted with an md5 hash.
We did find a file on the user's computer with the formula for passwords, however.  While the user uses a different password for each service, each one follows the same formula.  The formula was 'adjective' + 'animal' + 'number between 1 and 20' and the password always starts with a capital letter.

The md5 hash is ___HASH___.  Submit the actual password as the flag.

The flag is not in standard flag{} format.

Hint
------------
This user has a very small vocabulary... It's safe to say that they only know, say, the top 500 most common adjectives in the English language?

Flag
------------
