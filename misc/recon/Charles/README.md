Description
------------
My name is Charles Truluck.


Flag
------------

`flag{r3visions_d0nt_del3te_th1ings}`


Internal description
------------
I created a Gist with the flag, then I went back and changed it, so the only way to find the flag would be looking at the revision of the only Gist I had made. The easiest way to get this is to find my Github account and see all my Gists.
