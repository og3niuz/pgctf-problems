Description
------------
I lost a flag within my AP Computer Science 2016 answer... Can you find it?

Flag
------------

`flag{java_is_n0t_s3cure}`


Internal description
------------
Opening the file in your favorite java decompiler (JD-GUI, The Unarchiver, etc.) will show the Java class with the flag hidden in it.  Apparently the Atom text editor will even decompile for you.
