Description

I lost a flag within my AP Computer Science 2016 answer... Can you find it?

Flag
------------

`flag{java_0bfuscation_is_h4rd}`


Internal description

Opening the file in your favorite java decompiler (JD-GUI, The Unarchiver, etc.) will show the Java class with the flag hidden in it.
