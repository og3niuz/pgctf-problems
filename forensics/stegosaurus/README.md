Description
------------
After going through the files of a previous Ecorp employee We found this PNG file on his desktop. There seems to be something up with it. Can you find it?

Hint
------------
I wonder what the best way is to hide my flags in plain sight?

Flag
------------

`flag{t0_PNG_0r_n0t_PNG}`


Internal description
------------
This is a zip hidden within a png file.  Running 'unzip' on the Image  will reveal the file, flag.txt, inside of which contains the flag.
