## The D in Detroit
Forensics - 250 points

Description
------------
There's something off about this audio file, but I can't quite put my finger on it...

Internal description
------------
Opening this file in something like Audacity and viewing the spectrogram will reveal the flag encoded within the audio itself.  The flag is encoded on one of the channels, so splitting them may make it easier.

Flag
------------

`flag{back_h0me_well_sleep_b3tter}`
