todo:

* Figure out point value
  * This will definitely be one of the highest ranking ones
* Finish problem
  * XSS with AngularJS directives (not the standard <script>)
  * Horseman ([see this](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2015/blob/master/extras/infinity_star/api/horseman.js))
  * Figure out exactly how the vulnerability will give a flag (probably an angular function)
  * I wrote this in pug/jade/whatever it is this week to add to the difficulty
* Get someone who knows what they are doing to test it
